# CardiaRisk-Detection-System

Overview

CardiaRisk-Detection-System is a comprehensive project developed in Python, particularly utilizing Jupyter Notebook for data analysis, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis, and Tableau for creating insightful visualizations. The project aims to detect cardiac risk by analyzing heart attack data. Additionally, it's focused on developing an application that predicts heart attack risk by considering lifestyle and health factors, thereby enhancing proactive healthcare measures.

Features

- Data Analysis: Employs NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for in-depth analysis of heart attack data. Utilizes Jupyter Notebook for interactive data exploration and manipulation.
  
- Risk Prediction App Development: Currently, the project is dedicated to developing an application that predicts heart attack risk. This involves integrating machine learning models with lifestyle and health data to provide users with personalized risk assessments.
  
- Data Visualization: Utilizes Tableau for creating visually appealing and informative visualizations. These visualizations aid in transparent communication of risk assessments to users, enabling better understanding and decision-making.
